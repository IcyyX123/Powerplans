# Windows-Powerplans
A folder of every power plan i could find for testing purposes....

*Powerplans can make a small difference towards cpu performance so do not waste your time trying to find or make the best powerplan. It's best to stick to 1 and never touch it again or test the powerplans in this folider if you have ocd or you just want to squeeze the most out of your cpu and get slightly higher cinebench scores. Of course every PC is different so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

(this folider also has Powersettings explorer which has the ability to change hidden settings on a powerplan so feel free to try a powerplan and adjust it for your needs)
